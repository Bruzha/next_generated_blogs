### **Output format (follow these rules strictly):**
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array of Portable Text blocks, parseable by \`JSON.parse()\`
- Each block must follow this schema and Sanity schema:

Paragraph:
\`\`\`json
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "_key": "unique",
  "children": [
    { "_type": "span", "text": "Your text here", "marks": [] }
  ],
  "markDefs": []
}
\`\`\`

Heading:
\`\`\`json
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "h2" | "h3",
  "_key": "unique",
  "children": [
    { "_type": "span", "text": "Heading text", "marks": [] }
  ],
  "markDefs": []
}
\`\`\`

Quote:
\`\`\`json
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "blockquote",
  "_key": "unique",
  "children": [
    { "_type": "span", "text": "Quote text", "marks": [] }
  ],
  "markDefs": []
}
\`\`\`

List item:
\`\`\`json
{
  "_type": "block",
  "style": "normal",
  "listItem": "bullet" | "number",
  "level": 1,
  "_key": "unique",
  "children": [
    { "_type": "span", "text": "List item text", "marks": [] }
  ],
  "markDefs": []
}
\`\`\`

Image:
\`\`\`json
{
  "_type": "image",
  "_key": "unique",
  "alt": "Descriptive SEO friendly alt text",
  "dataImageDescription": "[IMAGE: detailed description about ${topic} and ${title}]"
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Important:**
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON
- Do NOT create custom types like "_type": "list" (lists must use "listItem" inside a block)
- Do NOT include SEO fields or metadata in the array
- Each block MUST have \`_key\` (unique string)
- Ensure valid JSON, no trailing commas
- All children must have \`_key\`
- If the dataImageDescription mentions a laptop or other piece of equipment, it is important to describe in detail their position, quantity, and how exactly they are turned in relation to the viewer. Any text that appears on the image is formatted in English and enclosed in quotation marks.
